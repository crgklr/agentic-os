SOLOSHOT™ XTREME – PBX-50
CCS TRACER WIRE
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
 50 mil HDPE insulation
 4,700 lb break load
 Strongest, most durable
 1,000 lbs stronger than 3/16”
stainless steel and equally
flexible
 3 times more conductive than
stainless steel
 Copper-clad steel (CCS) wire
combines the strength of hard
drawn high-carbon steel with the
conductivity and corrosion
resistance of solid copper
 Bonded metals mean no
separating, no corrosion, and no
theft appeal
 More stable pricing than solid
copper
 Provided exclusively by
Copperhead Industries
 Rated for direct bury
 Color-coded to meet American
Public Works (APWA) standards
for utility identification

APPLICATION
Stranded copper-clad steel (CCS) tracer wire. Install with underground
plastic utility pipes, wires, and cables to ensure future location. Best
choice for pipe bursting when a smaller pipe needs to be replaced
with a larger pipe, or extreme horizontal directional drilling applications
when there may be large boulders or concrete obstructions.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Tracer wire for pipe bursting and extreme directional drilling shall be Copperhead® SoloShot™ Xtreme 7 x7 stranded
CCS (3/16” outside diameter) hard drawn, high carbon conductor rated at 30 volts, insulated with 50 mil, high-density,
high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE) insulation rated for direct burial use at 600 volts. EHS-CCS conductor
must be at 21% conductivity for locate purposes. Break load of 4700 lbs. HDPE insulation shall be RoHS compliant
and utilize virgin grade material. Insulation color shall meet the APWA color code standard for identification of buried
utilities. Manufacturers supplying copper-clad steel tracer wire must have available detailed performance data
including 5 years of underground testing in terms of durability related to damage of protective insulation and effects
of potential corrosion of the specific copper-clad steel used. Origin of copper-clad steel manufacturer is required and
steel core must be manufactured in the United States. If manufacturer has not completed 5-year corrosion testing, a
5-year warranty must be provided. Tracer wire shall be Copperhead® SoloShot
™ Xtreme-CCS HDPE 50 mil and made
in the USA.

CONDUCTOR
This specification describes the properties of the conductor to be used in the fabrication of SoloShot Xtreme tracer
wire.
Material Description: Copperhead copper-clad steel wire as manufactured by Copperweld®. All single ends
composed of a steel core with a uniform and continuous copper cladding thoroughly bonded to the steel throughout.
Wire must conform to ASTM B1010 and ASTM B227.
• Cladding: The steel and copper interface must have a metallurgical bond achieved through a high heat and
pressure bonding process. Established process for porosity-free material.
• Steel: Extra-high strength with 0.54 carbon or greater. Verified to meet required mechanical properties.
• Copper: UNS-C10200; OF Copper according to ASTM B-170 (latest revision). High conductivity, oxygen free
copper to achieve optimal signal performance.
Surface Condition: Wire surface shall be free of any defects, including flakes, grooves, pits, and voids. Wire surface
shall be smooth, bright and shiny, and free of excessive copper dust and residual drawing lubricants.
Physical, Mechanical, and Electrical Properties: The wire shall conform to the properties listed in Table 1.

INSULATION
This specification describes the properties of the material to be used in the insulating of SoloShot Xtreme
tracer wire.
Material Description: Insulation is comprised of a co-polymer high molecular weight natural high density
polyethylene (HDPE) designed specifically for high-speed copper wire insulating. It contains the required levels
and types of primary antioxidant and metal deactivator additives to satisfy most Wire and Cable industry
requirements. HDPE material will be produced with an excellent balance of surface smoothness, processing
ease, tensile and elongation properties, abrasion toughness, environmental stress crack, thermal stress crack
resistance, and electrical consistency. Insulation must conform to ASTM D1248.
Physical, Mechanical, and Electrical Properties: The wire shall conform to the properties listed in Table 2.
