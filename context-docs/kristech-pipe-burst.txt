KRIS-TECH PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS
PIPE BURST TRACER WIRE
APPLICATION
Kris-Tech Pipe Burst Tracer Wire is installed for pipe bursting and critical
directional drilling applications where break load is essential.
DESCRIPTION
Kris-Tech Pipe Burst Tracer Wire is a stranded, copper-clad steel wire. With
a breaking strength of 4,750 pounds, it is stronger and more conductive than
stranded stainless steel wire traditionally used in pipe burst applications.
Kris-Tech’s pipe burst tracer wire has a durable, 50mils high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) insulation.
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
✓ Kris-Tech tracer wire is 7x7 stranded CCS hard drawn,
high carbon conductor rated at 30 volts
✓ Insulated with 50 mil, high-density, high molecular weight polyethylene
(HDPE) insulation rated for direct burial use at 1,000 volts
✓ HS-CCS conductor must meet or exceed 21%
conductivity for locate purposes
✓ Break load of 4,750 lbs
✓ HDPE insulation is RoHS compliant and utilizes virgin-grade materials
✓ Insulation colors meet the APWA color code
standard for buried utility identification
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
✓ Much stronger than traditional
pipe burst tracer wire and
three times more conductive
— 4,750 lb. break load
✓ Highly flexible, durable, and reliable
✓ Rugged 50 mil HDPE insulation
✓ ‘Theft-resistant’ (low aftermarket
value) and stable price history
compared to solid copper
✓ Rated for direct burial and color-
coded to meet APWA standards
✓ Exclusively manufactured
by Kris-Tech Wire

CLADDING
The steel and copper interface has a metallurgical bond achieved through
a high heat and pressure bonding process — the established process for
porosity-free material
• Extra High Strength Steel, with 0.54 carbon or greater, and verified to meet
all required mechanical properties
• Copper is UNS-C10200, OF Copper as per ASTM B-170 (latest revision).
High conductivity, oxygen-free copper is used to provide optimal signal
performance
• Surface Condition. Wire surface shall be defect-free, including flakes, pits,
voids, and grooves. Wire surface shall be smooth, with no excessive copper
dust and residual drawing lubricants
PHYSICAL, MECHANICAL, & ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES
The wire shall conform to the properties listed in Table 1 & Table 2.
Wound wire on a compact spool
made of plastic or wood.
