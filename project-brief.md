# 📱 AI-Native Interface Demo Brief

**Project Title:** “AgentOS: Pipe Burst Tracer Wire Discovery Demo”
**Client:** The Right Horse
**Demo Type:** Mobile Interactive Mockup (3-screen flow)
**Core Tech:** Cursor AI, pseudo-agent UX scaffolding
**Purpose:** Simulate how an AI-native platform replaces app-switching and fragmented workflows with intelligent, context-aware, on-demand software generation.

---

## 🧱 Platform Context (P)

> This AI interface represents a conceptual replacement for mobile operating systems. It is **not an app**, **not a Google search**, and **not a widget**. It’s a *computational surface* where AI responds to intent by generating adaptive, goal-oriented microtools.

The platform’s behavior is agentic and contextual. In this mockup, the AI:

* Understands user intent from natural language
* Retrieves structured product data (simulated via datasheets)
* Builds an evaluative interface for quick decision-making
* Spawns vendor-specific microexperiences using their visual identity and value proposition

---

## 🎨 Creative Vision (C)

**Overall Aesthetic:** Sleek, modern, AI-native UI.
**Theme:** Dark mode. Rounded card elements. Soft shadows. Elevated minimalist design.
**Typography:** Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter or SF Pro).
**Color Usage:**

* Core interface: Monochrome slate background (#111), white/gray typography
* Vendor pages: Custom color palettes per brand
* Weather/icons: Subtle animated SVGs if possible (static fine for mock)
* Micro-interactions: smooth transitions, hover/tap highlights

### 📎 Assets & Notes

* You may use placeholder logos if needed or extract them from the PDFs in the context-docs folder.
* Fonts should scale fluidly. All screens are designed for mobile portrait (iPhone 15 Pro-style screen size).
* Transitions between screens should imply intelligence: fade-throughs, microinteractions, no hard cuts.
